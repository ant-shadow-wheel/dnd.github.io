        The earliest memories are of crawling sounds in the dimly lit <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Underdark" target="_blank">
        Underdark</a>, where any good spirited ooze would be crushed by the lack of stimuli. Particularly for Blobert,
        after his best efforts to find Illumination from <span class="myref" id="id01underdarkfungi">contemplating the
        patterns in the pale frogs that inhabit giant fungi </span>, he branched out to understand the recent fascinations
        of his equals.<br><br>
        It turned out they'd made an amazing discovery: A healthy diet of drows and peculiar looking
        <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Derro" target="_blank">derros</a> - although sometimes their remains would suffice,
        when combined with an extended meditation inside an <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Aboleth" target="_blank">
        Aboleth</a> carcass, accompanied of course with a passive consumption of it, <span class="myref" id="id02ghostlywitches">
        made weirdly tattoed ghosts appear around them.</span><br><br>
        Not long after, he himself had undergone the process that promised a glimpse of the creatures and was desperate
        for a chance to map out their behavioural patterns as he had once failed to do so for frogs. <span class="myref" id="id03unwillingshowofpower">
        Noticing that was his sole focus, Blobert's unnwilling partner in the experiment uttered a weird sentence that caused an overwhelming -
        though temporary change in his surroundings</span>.<br><br>
        As he rushed to find his friends again to discuss the experience, he was surprised to find them speaking with beings
        that matched the descriptions of their visions <span class="myref" id="id04witcharmor"> (although this time heavily
        armored)</span>, but that seemed quite solid... real. So real in fact, they threw some weird energy at him in response
        <span class="myref" id="id05touchy">to his signature "verification bite"</span>.<br><br>
        His friends explained to him that these beings (witches) were capable to teach them about the ghosts they had seen. And they
        themselves could interact with the spirits in no time. Eager for a new opportunity for stimuli, plus the chance of a
        way to keep around the few shorter-lived friends they'd often make in the depths, <span class="myref" id="id06socials">
        the whole colony offered to take the witches in, an offer they seemed happy to accept.</span>.<br><br>
        They taught us that tying themselves to the Covenant of Steel meant combining spiritual connection with a grounding
        in eldritch combat. Our core devotion would then be the grim task of binding or banishing malign spirits, and then
        bending such spirits to our circular cause. Not to lose peace over the seemingly fruitless endeavor, much less dwell
        on the wellbeing of the spirits, as circumstance would indicate it was our duty to keep them from endangering the living.
        <br>But to truly learn the scale of their power, part of our training would be to tame one ourselves.<br>
        <span class="myref" id="id07spiritwarfare">
        When it was my units turn to do so, we walked into a sealed chamber where the teachers would release their spirits for us
        to try and overpower. After that, everything is fuzzy. I can recall her binding them again to her Club and clobbering us one after another.
        And when the massacre gave rise to another spirit, she happiliy captured it with a rite and headed to the door.<br>
        Consuming my own remains along with those physically closest to me I lunged after her and twisted my deformed limbs away
        to the best of my ability. Didn't see any of the other slimes on my out, which placed a grim mantle over the chance that my
        friends in the other units suffered a similar fate. I hold on to hope still.<br>
        <br>I intend to find Covenants of Steel with "higher authority" to whom I can report the incident, and hope for them to
        take that witch to justice. But welcome any other powers I might find in my journey, my ideal is more so truth and justice than vengeance.</span>

            <ul><li>New Purpose: (5) I hope to convince my former order to change and seek reconciliation</li>
            <li>Personality Trait: (2) I speak carefully, ensuring that I am understood</li>
            <li>Ideal: (1) Truth. I want to make sure people understand the true nature of things. (Good) - as a wisthleblower essentially</li>
            <li>Bond: (3) I left someone I care deeply about behind when I left my order. I believe they are trapped and need to be rescued.</li>

        <span class="myref" id="id08agathaallalong">
        <br>The spirits didn't go into the witch. They went inside me. And it wasn't an introduction, I was formerly a
        witch Covenant of Unity, practicing the Pale Host feature, but was too weak and succumbed to the spirit of Hate.<br>
        In this state I killed the rest of my "class", including the leading witch in the room. As my physiology absorbed
        the remains of other slimes and sort of restored my health, I was able to overpower the spirit but it came with the
        horrible realisation of my actions. The shock gave rise to many spirits of Guilt, and all these factors (damage,
        trauma, intense magic environment, spirits) sort of "reset" my conscience, and led me away with a single leading
        directive to think around: The banishment of spirits altogether.<br><br>A new personality formed around that principle,
        creating a coherent narrative for my past creating memories in between some flashbacks I'd get to see in my sleep (or were those nightmares?).<br>
        Nevertheless, I was new to banishing spirits though, so in my "reborn" form I start as a level 1 Witch of the Covenant of Steel.</span>
